# Introduction
- In this lab, you need to implement a conditional GAN to generate synthetic images according to multi-label conditions.
- To achieve higher generation capacity, especially in computer vision, generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed and has been widely applied on style transfer and image synthesis.
- In this lab, given a specific condition, your model should generate the corresponding synthetic images.
- For example, given “red cube” and “blue cylinder”, your model should generate the synthetic images with red cube and blue cylinder and meanwhile, input your generated images to a pre-trained classifier for evaluation.
