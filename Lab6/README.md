# Introduction
- Deep Q-Network and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
- In this lab, you will learn and implement two deep reinforcement algorithms by completing the following two tasks: 
  (1) solve LunarLander-v2 using deep Q-network (DQN), and 
  (2) solve LunarLanderContinuous-v2 using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG).
