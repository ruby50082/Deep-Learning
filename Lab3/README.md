# Introduction
- In this lab, you will need to analysis diabetic retinopathy (糖尿病所引發視網膜病變) in the following three steps.
- First, you need to write your own custom DataLoader through PyTorch framework.
- Second, you need to classify diabetic retinopathy grading via the ResNet architecture.
- Finally, you have to calculate the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance.
- Loss function: Cross entropy

# Dataset
- Diabetic Retinopathy Detection (kaggle)
- Format: .jpg
